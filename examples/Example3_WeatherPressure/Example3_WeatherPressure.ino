  This example shows how to take the absolute pressure from the sensor and convert it to
  sea level adjusted pressure, or the pressure that you would see from a weather underground station
  (or the pressure you would post to your own weather underground station).

  See "Mean Sea Level Pressure": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure#Mean_sea_level_pressure

  For this example you'll need to know the altitude of your workbench. We used 
  https://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm and estimated our local alittude at: 5373.6ft or 1637.9m

  Then change the .adjustToSeaLevel(pressure, 1637.9) function to use your local altitude the load this code
  onto your RedBoard or Uno. Open the terminal at 9600bps to see the various data. The final number
  is called "Weather Pressure" in inHg (inches Mercury).

  Next search the internet for a weather station near your home with roughly the same altitude. The 
  pressure on your desk should be approximately the same pressure as reported by the local weather station.
  For example, the weather in Boulder, CO: https://www.wunderground.com/weather/us/co/boulder
  reported "30.01 in" as pressure and the sensor "Weather Pressure" was 30.027

  Now you can build your own weather station and report the pressure at your house
